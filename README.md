# JSON VM
> A VM with JSON as it's storage engine

My go at writing a little VM that uses JSON as its core storage engine

## Components
- read path
- write path
- input object
- heap object
- output object
- stack
- basic arithmatic

Initially I won't suport branching, just linear oparations, I'll think about branching later
